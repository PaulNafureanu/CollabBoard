Notes for self:

1.:
  - you changed the db schema (you added 2 more roles and board name field)
  - this change should reflect in the server req handlers (eg. automatic board naming), in jest tests and public shapes / zod validation.
  - double check where this change could propagate and fix / modify the code as needed.
