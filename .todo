Notes for self:

1.:

- you changed the db schema (you added 2 more roles and board name field)
- this change should reflect in the server req handlers (eg. automatic board naming), in jest tests and public shapes / zod validation.
- double check where this change could propagate and fix / modify the code as needed.

  2.:

- you changed the db schema: renamed room'slug to room'name for better clarity without migration.
- migrate dev and change the http routes, jest tests and zod validators namings

What should it be for a max text message size in chars for zod validator for a chat app?
