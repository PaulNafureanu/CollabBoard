Anyhow, I think I am done with the zod validation and events. So let's check. Here's the prisma schema (all tables have dedicated RESTful APIs endpoints and much more, but now we check the socket events completness):

// This is your Prisma schema file,
// learn more about it in the docs: https://pris.ly/d/prisma-schema

  // Initially, the creator of the room. Full privileges: can edit board, manage members,
  // delete messages, and close the room. Multiple owners per room allowed.
  OWNER

  // Elevated editor(s) who can moderate: add/suspend/upgrade/downgrade/remove
  // members & messages, but cannot delete the room or change OWNER / PEER's roles.
  MODERATOR

  // Standard member(s) who can edit the shared board (draw, add elements, etc.),
  // and also send chat messages.
  EDITOR

  // Basic member(s) who can participate in chat but cannot modify the board.
  MEMBER

  // Read-only participants: can view board and messages but cannot interact.

  // Users waiting for approval to join the room.

  // Users that cannot send new join approval requests.

Now, the zod validation which then will infer from it the even types thus the events, are here:

import * as z from "zod";

/**

  userId: Id,
  username: Name,

I think it captures most of the operations if not all based on the schema and the socket. But maybe I also missed something.
